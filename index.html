 <p>Hello! I would like to take you someone I have been a certain part of the world that I carry with me.</p>

<h3>This place I'm talking about is  <a href="http://www.visitusvi.com/stcroix/homepage"> The Virgin Islands St. Croix </a></h3>
<p>The Virgin Islands are located just below <a href="http://www.topuertorico.org/">Puerto Rico</a>. In the winter time the weather is sensational. The beach waters are luke warm and the water crystal clear. 
</p>
<p>What are somethings we can do here?</p>
<ol>
	<ls>Paddle boarding while you stare down at all the fish swimming below your feet</ls>
	<ls>Beach concerts! All throughout the day at various beaches there is a band at the beach playing its caribbean island music</ls>

</ol>
